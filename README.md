Summary
 
 
After completing the analysis, Vine members did not seem to be bias when it comes to rating their products. This is because the number of 5-star ratings was about less than Non-Vine members. we can conclude that Vine customers value their review and are honest when giving feedback. Analyzing the data privdes us more insights which supports our assumption and predictions.
